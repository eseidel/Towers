# Towers
Playing around with Godot

Attempting to make league-of-legends like minion/tower interactions.

## TODOS
* Separate attack range from aggro range.
* Healthbars
* Add Melee minions
* Minion pathing is too-short-term and stacks them like pinball pins.
* Consider abstracting Minion and Tower into MOB?
* Add player controllable MOB
* Make camera follow player.
* Add vision?
